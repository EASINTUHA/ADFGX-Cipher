# ADFGX Cipher

This C# project implements the ADFGX Cipher, a historical cryptographic method used during World War I.

## Overview

The ADFGX Cipher is a field cipher that combines a modified Polybius square with a columnar transposition to achieve encryption.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Implementing the ADFGX encryption algorithm.
- **Decryption:** Decoding ADFGX encrypted messages.
- **Key Generation:** Generating ADFGX cipher keys for secure communication.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ADFGX-Cipher.git
